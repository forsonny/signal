# Signal

An AI agent runtime framework -- one interface, many specialists, running continuously.

## What Signal Is

Signal gives you a single agent, Prime, that you talk to directly. Behind Prime sits a network of specialist micro-agents, each scoped to a specific skill or domain. A heartbeat daemon keeps the system alive between conversations, firing triggers on schedules and events. Profiles are YAML manifests that define what an instance becomes -- its identity, its agents, its capabilities.

## Current Status

**Phase 3 of 10 complete.** Prime routes user messages to specialist micro-agents via LLM-based routing. Each micro-agent has its own skill-based system prompt and makes independent AI calls. An in-process message bus carries typed messages between agents with `talks_to` permission enforcement. When no specialist matches, Prime handles the request directly.

See the [roadmap](docs/dev/roadmap.md) for what is coming.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), an LLM API key (Anthropic recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/forsonny/signal.git
cd signal
uv sync --dev
```

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
uv run signal init --profile blank
uv run signal talk "hello"
```
